# Goof Troop Pushing Puzzle Game

Game developed for experiments and studies with Javascript language and "Canvas" HTML tag.

The mechanics and maps of the game were inspired by the game "Shove It! The Warehouse Game" (https://segaretro.org/Shove_It!_...The_Warehouse_Game)

I applied the apparence of a game that I used to play in my childhood called "Goof Troop" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hbce9kjONg)
