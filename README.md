# Goof Troop Pushing Puzzle Game

Game developed for experiments and studies with the Javascript language and the use of the "Canvas" HTML tag.

The mechanics and maps of the game were inspired by the game "Shove It! The Warehouse Game" (https://segaretro.org/Shove_It!_...The_Warehouse_Game)

I applied the look of a game that marked my childhood called "Goof Troop" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1MbPbwWdoI&ab_channel=Ruivo%E2%84%A2)
